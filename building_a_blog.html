        Building A Blog

        So why am I starting a blog in 2025? Well, frankly I'm making a lot of changes and starting multiple new chapters in my life in 2025, a blog is just one of them.
        But why am I building this blog? I want to document my journey into becoming a network engineer, share my thoughts on the subject, and connect with others who might be on similar paths.
