                <h2>“Why”: The Purpose Behind This Blog</h2>
                    <p>Well, frankly I'm making a lot of changes and starting multiple new chapters in my life—this blog is just one of them. But <i>why</i> am I building this blog? 
                    <p>In 2025, I’m launching a blog to share my firsthand experiences as a <strong>network engineer</strong> and <strong>web developer</strong>. This blog will:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Document my path toward becoming a certified <strong>CCNA and CCNP network engineer</strong>.</li>
                        <li>Connect with other <strong>tech enthusiasts</strong> and professionals navigating similar career paths.</li>
                    </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="how-blog">
                <h2>“How”: Building &amp; Growing This Platform</h2>
                <p>My goal is to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Design responsive layouts with <strong>HTML5</strong> &amp; <strong>CSS3</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Experiment with basic <strong>JavaScript</strong> for interactivity.</li>
                    <li>Automate deployment using <strong>Git</strong> and CI/CD pipelines.</li>
                    <li>Leverage AI to brainstorm content, generate code snippets, and optimize my workflow—always vetting and customizing every output to ensure originality.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>My Background in Web Development</h2>
                    <p>My journey started back in 2008, during my college years. Computer science always intrigued me, and I wanted to learn how to build programs of my own. I began with HTML and CSS, then moved on to PHP and MySQL. I built a few small projects for school but never pursued it seriously at the time.</p>
                    <p>Despite my interest in computer science, I chose a different path. I struggled with math, and at the time, it felt like a barrier to entering the field. So, I shifted toward IT—specifically networking—because it was more approachable for me, and I've made it into a fulfilling career for myself. Still, the passion to create—especially with code—never went away</p>
                    <p>This blog is a way for me to rekindle that passion.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="my-networking-journey">
                <h2>My Journey in Networking</h2>
                    <p>Fast forward to 2025, I’m now a network engineer with over 10 years of experience. I’ve worked with everything from small business networks to large enterprise systems. I’ve seen the evolution of networking technologies—from the rise of cloud computing to the increasing importance of automation and AI.</p>
                    <p>As I continue to grow in my career, I want to share what I learn along the way. This blog will be a space for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hands-on tutorials</li>
                        <li>Configuration examples</li>
                        <li>Real-world troubleshooting tips</li>
                    </ul>
            </section>

        <h2>What You Can Expect</h2>
            <p>If you're exploring networking as a career, dabbling in programming, or curious about how AI and automation fits into tech workflows, you’ll find real-world insights here. I’ll be documenting:</p>
                <ul>
