            I am a geek, a nerd, a network engineer, and a gamer.

        <h2>What I'm working on</h2>
        <p>
            I'm obsessed with learning new technologies, especially in the fields of networking. Currently, I'm diving deep into cloud computing and automation.
            To keep up with my learning journey, I decided to create a blog to document my experiences and keep me on track.
            For the rest of June 2025, I've set a goal to build a bad ass home lab that will help me experiment with various networking technologies and cloud platforms.
