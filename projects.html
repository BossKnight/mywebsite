                        I’m tackling a variety of <strong>network engineering projects</strong> to expand my skills and home lab capabilities:
                    </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>RetroPie Gaming Server:</strong> Building a RetroPie console on a Raspberry Pi 4B to play older and lost video games.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Wired Home Office Upgrade:</strong> Wiring my home office to move gaming consoles and workstations off Wi-Fi and onto a stable, gigabit Ethernet network.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Locally Hosted LLM:</strong> Deploying a small <em>large language model</em> in my lab environment for on-prem inference and privacy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>AI-Powered Security Cameras:</strong> Designing an enhanced home security system using Raspberry Pi boards and the official AI Camera Module.
                    </li>
                </ul>
