                I'm currently working on multiple networking projects. I'm building a Retro Pie using a Raspberry Pi 4B. I'm wiring up my home office with the goal of getting video game consoles off of Wi-Fi and onto 
                a wired connection for a stable connection. I'm building a locally hosted Large Language Model (LLM). I'm building an enhanced home security camera system using Raspberry Pi's and the Raspberry 
                Pi AI Camera Module.
